            "text": "Install Software\n\n\nThis guide will help you to setup the software to run Donkey on your Raspberry Pi, as well as the host PC operating system of your choice.\n\n\n\n\nSetup \nRaspberryPi\n\n\nSetup \nLinux Host PC\n\n\nSetup \nWindows Host PC\n\n\nSetup \nMac Host PC\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the Raspberry Pi working.\n\n\nBefore we can do anything we have to get our car's computer connected to the \ninternet. The fastest way is to use the disk image created for donkey cars. \n\n\nThe method for using a disk image to create a bootable SD card varies between\noperating systems. These instructions are for Ubuntu but you can see more \ninstructions \nhere\n.\n\n\n\n\nDownload \nzipped disk image\n (900MB). \n\n\nUnzip the disk image.\n\n\nPlug your SD card into your computer.\n\n\nOpen the \"Startup Disk Creator\" application.\n\n\nSelect your source disk image as the one you unzipped earlier.\n\n\nSelect your SD card as the disk to use. \n\n\nClick \"Make startup disk\".\n\n\n\n\nSetup the Pi's WiFi for first boot\n\n\nWe can create a special file which will be used to login to wifi on first boot. More reading \nhere\n, but we will walk you through it. \n\n\nOn Windows, with your memory card image burned and memory disc still inserted, you should see two drives, which are actually two partitions on the mem disc. One is labled \nboot\n. On Mac and Linux, you should also have access to the \nboot\n partition of the mem disc. This is formated with the common FAT type and is where we will edit some files to help it find and log-on to your wifi on it's first boot.\n\n\n\n\nStart a text editor: \ngedit\n on Linux. Notepad on Windows. TextEdit on a Mac.\n\n\nPaste and edit this contents to match your wifi:\n\n\n\n\ncountry=US\nctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev\nupdate_config=1\n\nnetwork={\n    ssid=\"<your network name>\"\n    psk=\"<your password>\"\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nReplace \n<your network name>\n with the ID of your network. Leave the quotes. I've seen problems when the network name contained an apostrophe, like \"Joe's iPhone\".\nReplace \n<your password>\n with your password, leaving it surrounded by quotes. \nIf it bothers you to leave your password unencrypted, you may change the \ncontents later\n once you've gotten the pi to boot and log-in.\n\n\n\n\nSave this file to the root of \nboot\n partition with the filename \nwpa_supplicant.conf\n. On first boot, this file will be moved to \n/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf\n where it may be edited later.\n\n\n\n\nSetup Pi's Hostname\n\n\nWe can also setup the hostname so that your Pi easier to find once on the network. If yours is the only Pi on the network, then you can find it with \n\n\nping raspberrypi.local\n\n\n\n\nonce it's booted. If there are many other Pi's on the network, then this will have problems. If you are on a Linux machine, or are able to edit the UUID partition, then you can edit the \n/etc/hostname\n and \n/etc/hosts\n files now to make finding your pi on the network easier after boot. Edit those to replace \nraspberrypi\n with a name of your choosing. Use all lower case, no special characters, no hyphens, yes undersores \n_\n. \n\n\nsudo vi /media/userID/UUID/etc/hostname\nsudo vi /media/userID/UUID/etc/hosts\n\n\n\n\nNow you're SD card is ready. Eject it from your computer, put it in the Pi \nand plug in the Pi.\n\n\nConnecting to the Pi\n\n\nIf you followed the above instructions to add wifi access you're Pi should\nnow be connected to your wifi network. Now you need to find it's IP address\nso you can connect to it via SSH. \n\n\nThe easiest way (on Ubuntu) is to use the \nfindcar\n donkey command. You can try \nping raspberrypi.local\n. If you've modified the hostname, then you should try: \nping <your hostname>.local\n. This will fail on a windows machine. Windows users will need the full ip address (unless using cygwin). \n\n\nIf you are having troubles locating your Pi on the network, you will want to plug in an HDMI monitor and USB keyboard into the Pi. Boot it. Login with username: \npi\n, password: \nraspberry\n. Then try the command:\n\n\nifconfig wlan0\n\n\n\n\nIf this has a valid ip V4 address, 4 numbers separated with a dot, then you can try that with your ssh command. If you don't see anything like that, then your wifi config might have a mistake. You can try to fix with\n\n\nsudo nano /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf\n\n\n\n\nIf you don't have a hdmi monitor and keyboard, you can plug-in the Pi with a CAT5 cable to a router with DHCP. If that router is on the same network as your PC, you can try:\n\n\nping raspberrypi.local\n\n\n\n\nHopefully, one of those methods worked and you are now ready to ssh into your Pi. On Mac and Linux, you can open Terminal. On Windows you can install \nPutty\n or \none of the alternatives\n.\n\n\nIf you have a command prompt, you can try:\n\n\nssh pi@raspberrypi.local\n\n\n\n\nor\n\n\nssh pi@<your pi ip address>\n\n\n\n\nor via Putty - username: \npi\n, password: \nraspberry\n hostname:\n<your pi ip address>\n\n\nIf you are using the prebuilt image specified above, then your Pi is ready to go. You should see a d2 and donkey directory. \n\n\n\n\nNote: Check config.py to make sure it uses the correct settings for the PWM channel for steering and throttle. Open config.py \nnano ~/d2/config.py\n and make sure that you see the lines:\n\n\n\n\nSTEERING_CHANNEL = 1\n\n\nTHROTTLE_CHANNEL = 0\n\n\n\n\nThe 1 and 0 for the parts arguments should match whichever channel you used to plug your servo/ESC leads in to your 9685 board. Usually this ranges from 0-15 and it numbered on the board.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow let's setup things on your PC. Install varies depending on platform.\n\n\nInstall donkeycar on Linux\n\n\nsudo apt-get install virtualenv build-essential python3-dev gfortran libhdf5-dev\nvirtualenv env -p python3\nsource env/bin/activate\ngit clone https://github.com/wroscoe/donkey donkeycar\npip install -e donkeycar\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstall donkeycar on Windows\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstall \nminiconda Python 3.6 64 bit\n.

You've installed it directly from the github repo, so getting latest is easy:\n     \ncd donkey\n    git pull origin master\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOccasionally also the template files have changed with fixes that affect manage.py. You can create a new user directory to test. Use the same options you used to create it \nfrom setup instructions\n but a new path. For instance:\n    \ndonkey createcar --path ~/d2_new",
